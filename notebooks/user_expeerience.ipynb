    "# Telecom Data Analysis: User Experience and Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a structured overview of the telecom data analysis process, highlighting key tasks, outputs, and methodologies.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Main Tasks Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1: Database Connection and Data Retrieval**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Fetch user data from a PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "- **Key Steps**:\n",
    "  - Establish a connection using environment variables (`dotenv`).\n",
    "  - Execute SQL queries to retrieve metrics related to user engagement and network experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Prepare data for analysis by handling missing values and outliers.\n",
    "- **Key Steps**:\n",
    "  - Replace missing values with statistical measures:\n",
    "    - Numerical columns: Replace with the mean.\n",
    "    - Categorical columns: Replace with the mode.\n",
    "  - Handle outliers in key metrics (`avg_tcp_retrans`, `avg_rtt`, `avg_throughput`) using the IQR method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3: User Engagement Analysis**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Analyze user engagement to identify high-value users and group behavioral patterns.\n",
    "- **Key Outputs**:\n",

    "    - User behavior visualized through PCA plots of engagement clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 4: User Experience Analysis**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Evaluate network experience metrics for clustering and device-level insights.\n",
    "- **Key Outputs**:\n",
    "  - Distribution analysis of metrics:\n",
    "    - TCP retransmission volume, Round Trip Time (RTT), and throughput.\n",
